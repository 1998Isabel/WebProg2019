# Practice02 Peer Review

1. Completeness:
> 100/100 (baseline)

2. Code Quality:
> Clear and neat, very easy to understand.
> 
> Here are some details that could be noticed:
> * Use `===` instead of `==` to compare two values.
> * Don't forget to add `;` at the end of line. 
> (main.js: line 8, line 37)

3. Correctness:
> Pretty nice. It looks alright, except for the link of "source". I think it should also change as you change the image.

4. Pros:
> * Clear and comprehensive.

5. Cons:
> * Could put more emphasis on details.

6. Other Suggestions:
> The functions `previousImage()` and `nextImage()` have some duplication. Perhaps they can be merged into a single function to make the code more concise.
